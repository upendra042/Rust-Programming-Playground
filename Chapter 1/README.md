# Chapter 1: Introduction to Rust - Programming Exercises

This repository contains solutions to the programming exercises from Chapter 1, which covers the basics of Rust programming including formatting, printing, variables, scope, shadowing, data types, arrays, tuples, constants, and strings.

---

## Topics Covered

- Basic output with `print!` and `println!`
- Formatting and placeholders
- Comments in Rust
- Variables, mutability, and shadowing
- Scope rules
- Data types: integers, floats, booleans, characters, strings, arrays, tuples
- Constants
- String objects and conversions

---

## Exercises

### 1. Display output using `print!`

Write a program that outputs text to the console using the `print!` macro.

### 2. Display pattern using placeholders

Print the following pattern:
1
22
333
4444
55555

### 3. Variable declaration and modification

- Declare a variable `x` with value `1000`
- Declare a variable `y` with value `"Programming"`
- Print values of `x` and `y`
- Change `x` to `1100`
- Print values again

### 4. Implement Scope and Shadowing

Demonstrate how variables are scoped and shadowed in Rust.

### 5. Implicit and Explicit Type Declaration

- Implicit type declaration
- Explicit type declaration

### 6. Declare and print an array

Create an array `arr` of size 6 containing even numbers from 0 to 10, and print it.

### 7. Create and access a tuple

Create a tuple with different types and print each element.

### 8. Array slicing

Given an array of 10 elements:

- Slice 2nd and 3rd elements
- Omit start index of slice
- Omit end index of slice
- Omit both start and end index of slice

### 9. Constants

Create constants of different types and print them.

### 10. String object and string literal conversion

Declare a `String` object and convert a string literal into a `String` object.
