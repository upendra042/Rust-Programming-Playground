# Chapter 3: Rust Conditionals and Loops - Programming Exercises

This repository contains solutions to the programming exercises from Chapter 3, which covers Rust conditionals, `if` expressions, `if let` expressions, `match` expressions, and Rust loops including `for`, `while`, and `loop`. The exercises also demonstrate control flow mechanisms such as `break`, `continue`, and loop labels.

## Topics Covered

- Conditional Expressions: `if`, `if let`, `match`
- Rust Loops: `for`, `while`, `loop`
- Control Flow: `break`, `continue`
- Nested Loops
- Loop Labels
- Pattern Matching
